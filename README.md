**1D Steady Convection–Diffusion Equation**

Finite Difference Solution using UDS and CDS (Pe = 50)

📌 Overview

This repository contains a complete numerical solution of the steady one-dimensional convection–diffusion equation using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The problem is convection-dominated with a Peclet number Pe = 50, making it suitable for studying the behavior and accuracy of different discretization schemes.

Two convection discretization methods are implemented and compared:

UDS — Upwind Differencing Scheme

CDS — Central Differencing Scheme

Both uniform and nonuniform grids are investigated, and the numerical results are compared against the analytical solution.
